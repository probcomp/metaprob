    "Why is the answer lower in the intervention trace method? Under our model, men are more likely to be 70 inches tall than women, so if we know someone is 70 inches tall, we might expect it's more likely for them to be a man, and—incorporating the wage gap—we might expect their salary to be higher. The rejection sampling algorithm takes this into account. It simply waits for 100 samples where the height was 70 inches, the majority of which will be men; the salary will have been higher for those samples, so the expected salary will be higher.\n",

    "The intervention method, on the other hand, is impatient, and immediately sets height to 70 in every run, severing the tie between gender and height. That means that our collection of 100 samples will contain just as many 70-inch-tall women as 70-inch-tall men, which is improbable under our model.\n",

We still artificially set the height of each sample to 70, but also measure how likely the model _would have been_ to choose 70 anyway—a number that will be higher for `sex=:m` samples than for `sex=:f` samples. (For those familiar with probability theory, we're talking about probability densities: `p(height=70|sex)`.) At the end, we take a _weighted average_ of the salaries, where each salary is weighted by the likelihood that the employee really would have been 70 inches (given the random choices we'd already made about them: their sex)."

    "One technique we can use to get more accurate samples than sampling/importance resampling in less time than rejection sampling is to use \"Markov Chain Monte Carlo\" (MCMC) methods. These methods involve starting with a single sample and iteratively changing it, in such a way that eventually, each successive iteration yields a sample from the posterior. There are many ways to do this, but below, we use an algorithm called Single-Site Metropolis Hastings, which (in our case) will iteratively propose changes to one brother's height at a time, then randomly deciding to either accept or reject the proposal. (The probability with which a proposal is accepted depends on a couple factors, including how likely our constraint is given the proposal.)"
